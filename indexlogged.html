                        There are several toolchains involved in the automation process. Here’s a simplified example for the sake of illustrating concept: The developer checks the application code into a repository such as github. As soon as the code is committed, tools such as Jenkins automate the build and test process.Upon successful test execution, the application is moved to the “Staging” area before it is deployed into Production. Feedback is provided to the application development teams at every step of the way. This is the Continuous Integration (CI) process. Deployment into Production can also be automated where the application is constantly monitored, scaled and supported by the Ops teams, a process often referred to as Continuous Deployment (CD).

                        While there is significant automation in the software development and deployment part, without infrastructure automation, the DevOps process is still suboptimal.

                        Looking at the world today, more and more applications are being published and pushed to clouds. The rate of growth for cloud native applications is in the double digits.  Unfortunately, there are still misperceptions about cloud computing.

                        The most significant one is that all clouds are created equal.  People also seem to think that they save money by being in the public cloud – a painful experience if you have to move your data and discover that the public cloud infrastructure and services have locked you in. Another illusion is that their data is automatically safe and they don’t have to worry about backup or retention policies because “when I put it there, it’s always going to be there.”
